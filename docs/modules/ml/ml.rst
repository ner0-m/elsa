This is the documentation of elsa's ml module. It provides a convenient integration
of common techniques for tomographic reconsturction into a fully fledged Deep
Learning framework. 

Get started by reading a :ref:`first example <elsa-ml-first-example>` or jump
directly to the :ref:`API documentation <elsa-ml-api>`.

You can read more about the following topics:

#. :ref:`Getting started <elsa-ml-first-example>` gives a basic overview on how to construct networks and how to train them.
#. :ref:`Constructing complex graph tologies <elsa-ml-complex-graphs>` introduces non-sequential network topologies.
#. :ref:`Using elsa ml for Tomographic Reconstruction <elsa-ml-recon>` gives an overview on how to use common techniques for tomographic reconstruction in elsa's ml module.
#. :ref:`Choosing a Backend <elsa-ml-backends>` gives an overview on available Deep Learning backends.
