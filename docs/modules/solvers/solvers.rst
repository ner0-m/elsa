This is the documentation of elsa's solvers module. It provides implementations of different iterative solvers for
general or more specific optimisation problems.

Get started by reading a quick overview on :ref:`which solver to choose <elsa-solvers-choosing-a-solver>` or jump
directly to the :ref:`API documentation <elsa-solvers-api>`.

You can read more about the following topics:

#. :ref:`Choose a solver <elsa-solvers-choosing-a-solver>` gives a basic overview over the different solvers and their strengths.
#. :ref:`Ordered Subsets <elsa-solvers-ordered-subsets>` gives an overview over ordered subsets and supported solvers.
#. :ref:`Solvers API <elsa-solvers-api>` provides a full documentation on the elsa solvers API.
