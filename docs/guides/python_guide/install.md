Install Python Bindings
------------------------

Setup the python bindings Once you've cloned _elsa_, change into the directory and simply run
`pip install .`. This will build _elsa_ and install including the Python bindings. In case you
wonder what is happening, add the `--verbose` flag to see the progress.

### Verify installation

Once everything is set up simply open a Python interpreter and run
```python
import pyelsa as elsa
```
to check everything is working.
