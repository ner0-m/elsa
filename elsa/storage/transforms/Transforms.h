 *  \{
 *  Transforms are algorithms which take an list as input and return a list. Transformations do not
 *  change the rank of a given tensor.
 *
 *  Currently, common binary transformations such as component wise (in place) addition,
 *  subtraction, multiplication, and division are implement. Many mathematical component wise unary
 *  transformations such as square, square root and logarithm.
