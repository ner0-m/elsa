/*! \addtogroup reductions
 *  \{
 *  Reductions are algorithms which reduce lists of values into a single value. Given a r-rank
 *  tensor reductions lower the rank to an arbitary value. But so far, only reductions to 0-rank
 *  tensors (i.e. scalars) are implemented.
 *
 *  In this case, some of the common mathematical reductions or functionals are implemented. This
 *  includes binary reductions as the dot/scalar product. But also many unary reductions and norms,
 *  such as the \f$\ell^1\f$ or the \f$\ell^2\f$.
