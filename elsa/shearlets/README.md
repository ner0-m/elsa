This package contains a summary of relevant and potentially useful components. It is continuously
changing and adapting to new findings. There are also quite a few TODOs spread out which are 
looking to be addressed.

# TODO
- Rename this package before creating any MR
- Create other packages out of this or merge to existing ones, if needed
- How does the inverse shearlet transform algorithm look like? Where is it defined?
    Is SH "orthogonal", i.e. SH^-1 = SH^T?
